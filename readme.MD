This project was created while tackling an assignment on bayesian learnning in pyagrum, a Python package that can be used to infer, create, explore, compare, ... Bayesian Networks and derivatives.
I can only refer to a [pdf](https://github.com/wilfred11/agr_opdracht2/blob/master/opdracht2-brml-wvc.pdf) describing the different functions that were created to complete the assignment. This project only slightly differs from the version I used to write the pdf.
