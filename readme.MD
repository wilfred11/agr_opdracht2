This project was created while tackling an assignment on bayesian learnning in pyagrum, a Python package that can be used to infer, create, explore, compare, ... Bayesian Networks and derivatives.
I can only refer to a pdf describing the different functions that were created to complete the assignment. As the project was changed slightly after creating the pdf it only differs only in the details.
